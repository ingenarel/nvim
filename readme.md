- make sure that you don't have a nvim directory in your config. and if you do, rename it to something.
- clone this bitch.
- install vim-plug from the official repo
    https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug
- use command `PlugUpdate`
- run `COQdeps` if it tells you to.
- if running for the first time, mason should start to install all the language servers. run `:Mason` to see the process.

<!--- for installing language servers:-->
<!--    ```-->
<!--    MasonUpdate pyright-->
<!--    ``` -->
- need to have lazygit installed for the lazygit plugin to work.
